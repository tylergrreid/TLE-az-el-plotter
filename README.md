# Two Line Element Reader / Elevation Angle Plotter #

Given multiple NORAD Two-Line-Element (TLE) files, this matlab code plots the orbits of the satellites along with their elevation angle to a point of interest and skyplot. It also outputs the satellite setting times to the terminal.

## How to Use ##

'MAIN_TLE_READ_Multifile.m' reads in specified TLE files and plots their orbits around Earth. TLE orbit data be downloaded from the Celestrak website: http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/master.asp
